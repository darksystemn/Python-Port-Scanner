How a Port Scanner Works

    *Target IP: You need the IP address of the machine you want to scan.
    *Port Range: You specify which ports you want to scan (a specific port, a range, or all ports).
    *Packet Sending: The scanner sends different types of packets (like SYN or UDP) to each port.
    *Response Analysis: Based on the response, the scanner determines whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
